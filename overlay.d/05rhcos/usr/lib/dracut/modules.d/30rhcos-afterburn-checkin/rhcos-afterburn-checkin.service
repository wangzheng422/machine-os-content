# Add an RHCOS specific initramfs checkin for Azure. Also disable
# the checkin from the real root as that is redundant.
# Context: this is for installer UX considerations. The provision
# success check masks issues with Ignition configs because it runs
# after Ignition (which may never conclude). Terraform will also
# report that nothing is progressing (as it is waiting for the checkin
# even though things are. Kube will do the actual health handling
# for the machine.

# Since we don't care about the actual success of the boot
# from the OS perspective, check in as soon as we are able.
#
# On Azure, checkin causes removal of the virtual CD with the
# userdata, so we need to wait until after Ignition fetch.
# (Waiting for fetch-offline is not sufficient if the config
# references network resources, which it usually does in RHCOS.)
After=ignition-fetch.service

# FIPS or Ignition kargs may schedule a reboot of the machine, which
# happens in coreos-kargs-reboot.service.  Afterward we need to be
# able to fetch the config again.  Removal of the virtual CD persists
# across reboots, so defer it until after the kargs reboot.
After=coreos-kargs-reboot.service

# Run before switching root.
