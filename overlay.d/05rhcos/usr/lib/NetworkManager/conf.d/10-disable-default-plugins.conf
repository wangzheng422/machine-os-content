# Prefer keyfiles by listing the keyfile plugin first in the plugin list. This
# overrides the default plugins and will cause any new networking configuration
# written by NetworkManager in RHCOS to be written out to keyfiles instead of
# ifcfg files. User's can still bring their own ifcfg files and they will still
# work. This just changes the default format/location of generated configuration.
